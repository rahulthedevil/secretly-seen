# Secretly Seen

Feel free to download it and modify and use it for any purpose

Block Seen feature on Facebook™ Messages.
This extension helps to remove the 'seen' feature from Facebook™ and Facebook™ Messenger. You'll be unseen on Facebook™ and Facebook™ messenger even when you read the messages your friend sends to you.

Have your friends been mad at you because they noticed you saw their message, and you didn't respond to it? Have you ever wished to use the messenger without people noticing if you have read their messages?

Install this software extension and when you use Facebook™ Messenger on the desktop browser, our software will completely remove the “seen” feature from the messenger. So your friends won’t be able to tell if you read their messages.
